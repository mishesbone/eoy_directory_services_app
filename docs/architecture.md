# eoy Directory Services - Architecture Overview

## Introduction
eOY Directory Services is an enterprise-grade identity and access management system built for scalability, security, and extensibility. The architecture leverages modern technologies to provide core directory services with enhanced capabilities powered by AI for anomaly detection and role recommendation.


## High-Level Architecture

### Components
1. **Frontend**:
   - Built using React for a responsive and intuitive user interface.
   - Interfaces with the backend via RESTful APIs.
   - Provides role-based access to administrative and user functionalities.

2. **Backend**:
   - Developed using Python and FastAPI for high performance and scalability.
   - Provides RESTful APIs for user, group, and access management.
   - Integrates AI-based anomaly detection and role recommendation.

3. **Database**:
   - PostgreSQL for structured and reliable data storage.
   - Handles user records, group memberships, role definitions, and activity logs.

4. **AI Services**:
   - Anomaly detection and role recommendation implemented with machine learning models.
   - TensorFlow/PyTorch models are trained offline and integrated into the backend.

5. **Dockerized Deployment**:
   - All services are containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scaling.
   - Orchestrated using Docker Compose for local and production environments.

## System Design

### 1. Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React.js with reusable components.
- **State Management**: Redux for managing application state.
- **Routing**: React Router for seamless navigation.
- **Features**:
  - User dashboard for managing profiles and roles.
  - Admin interface for directory management and insights.



### 2. Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: FastAPI for RESTful API development.
- **Key Modules**:
  - `authentication.py`: Handles user authentication, token issuance, and validation.
  - `user_management.py`: Manages CRUD operations for user entities.
  - `group_management.py`: Handles group creation, membership, and permissions.
  - `anomaly_detection.py`: AI module for detecting unusual behavior.
  - `role_recommendation.py`: AI module for suggesting roles to users.
- **Database ORM**: SQLAlchemy for object-relational mapping.



### 3. Database Design
#### Key Tables:
- **Users**:
  - `id`: Primary key.
  - `username`, `email`, `hashed_password`: User credentials.
  - `role_id`: Foreign key referencing `Roles`.
  
- **Roles**:
  - `id`: Primary key.
  - `name`: Role name.
  - `permissions`: JSON field storing role permissions.

- **Groups**:
  - `id`: Primary key.
  - `name`: Group name.
  - `description`: Optional group metadata.

- **Activity Logs**:
  - `id`: Primary key.
  - `user_id`: Foreign key referencing `Users`.
  - `action`: Activity performed.
  - `timestamp`: When the activity occurred.

### 4. AI Integration
- **Anomaly Detection**:
  - Utilizes user activity logs to identify potential security risks.
  - Trained on historical user behavior patterns using TensorFlow.

- **Role Recommendation**:
  - Leverages user actions and job descriptions to recommend appropriate roles.
  - Models are trained offline and loaded into the backend for inference.

---

### 5. Deployment
- **Local Development**:
  - Services run in isolated Docker containers.
  - Hot-reloading enabled for frontend and backend.

- **Production Deployment**:
  - Reverse proxy using Nginx for serving both frontend and backend.
  - Load balancing and scaling with Kubernetes (optional for advanced setups).

---

## Future Enhancements
1. **Integration with Third-Party Identity Providers**:
   - Support for OAuth2, SAML, and OpenID Connect.
2. **Advanced Analytics Dashboard**:
   - Real-time insights into system usage and performance.
3. **Multi-Tenancy Support**:
   - Allowing different organizations to manage their directory services independently.
