## Compliance Frameworks

### 1. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- **Purpose**: Protect user privacy and data rights within the European Union.
- **Compliance Measures**:
  - User data encryption in transit and at rest.
  - Consent management for data collection.
  - Data access, portability, and deletion capabilities.
  - Logging and auditing of all data access and processing activities.

---

### 2. ISO/IEC 27001
- **Purpose**: Establish, implement, maintain, and continually improve an Information Security Management System (ISMS).
- **Compliance Measures**:
  - Secure authentication and access controls.
  - Regular risk assessments and vulnerability scanning.
  - Role-based access management to ensure least privilege.
  - Incident response plan for security breaches.

---

### 3. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 800-53
- **Purpose**: Provide security and privacy controls for federal information systems.
- **Compliance Measures**:
  - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation.
  - Secure logging and monitoring of user activity.
  - Data backup and disaster recovery plans.
  - Continuous monitoring of system security and performance.

---

### 4. Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
- **Purpose**: Secure handling of credit card data.
- **Compliance Measures**:
  - Tokenization and encryption of sensitive payment data.
  - Role-based restrictions for accessing payment-related data.
  - Regular penetration testing and vulnerability management.

---

## Security Practices

### Data Security
- All user data is encrypted using AES-256 for storage.
- TLS 1.3 is used for secure communication between the client and server.

### Identity and Access Management
- Users are authenticated via secure tokens (JWT) with expiration policies.
- Role-based and group-based access controls enforce least privilege.

### Logging and Monitoring
- Logs are securely stored and accessible only to authorized personnel.
- Anomaly detection monitors for unusual user behavior in real-time.

---

## Auditing and Reporting

### Activity Logging
- All user and admin activities are logged with timestamps, IP addresses, and action details.
- Logs are immutable and tamper-proof.

### Compliance Reports
- System generates compliance reports for GDPR, ISO 27001, and NIST standards.
- Automated checks for data retention policies and access permissions.

---

## Incident Response

### Preparedness
- Regular tabletop exercises simulate potential breaches.
- Defined communication channels for internal and external stakeholders.

### Response
- Immediate containment and isolation of affected systems.
- Root cause analysis to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.

### Recovery
- System restore from secure backups.
- Comprehensive post-incident reporting and process review.

## Future Enhancements
1. **HIPAA Compliance**:
   - Ensuring the system meets requirements for securing healthcare data.
2. **SOX Compliance**:
   - Implementing controls for financial and operational data integrity.
3. **CSA STAR Certification**:
   - Demonstrating cloud security readiness.


## Conclusion
eOY Directory Services integrates robust compliance and security practices to meet global regulatory requirements, ensuring user trust and system reliability. These measures position the platform as a leader in secure identity and access management systems.
